## 1. Project Background & Objectives

### Background  
Network pharmacology has become a key method for modernizing and mechanistically studying Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM).  
However, the research process ‚Äî from herb-component-target-disease data collection, relation building, to network analysis (e.g., PPI, Random Walk with Restart) ‚Äî is often **tedious and time-consuming**, requiring extensive manual effort.  

While there are databases and partial tools available, **no end-to-end, AI-driven system** currently exists to help generate mechanistic hypotheses or integrate knowledge from multiple biomedical sources automatically.

### Objectives  

HerbAgent is built with the following goals:  

- **Automation**: Automate the full research workflow ‚Äî from inputting herbs/formulas to target prediction, network construction, and report generation.  
- **Intelligent Assistance**: Utilize LLM-powered agents to assist hypothesis generation, reasoning, and literature extraction.  
- **Modularity & Extensibility**: Each module (target prediction, network analysis, visualization, etc.) is modular and easy to replace.  
- **Explainability & Traceability**: Provide interpretable intermediate results and reasoning chains.  
- **Generalizability**: Although focused on TCM, the architecture can be extended to Western medicine or systems biology applications.

### Multi-Agent Architecture  

HerbAgent employs a **multi-agent system**, where each agent is responsible for a specific subtask in the research workflow:  

- **Herb‚ÄìTarget Agent**: Predicts potential compounds and molecular targets for given herbs or formulas.  
- **Syndrome‚ÄìDisease Agent**: Maps TCM syndromes to modern biomedical diseases.  
- **Network Analysis Agent**: Builds the compound-target-disease network and performs network-level analysis (e.g., PPI, RWR, topology).  
- **Hypothesis / Report Agent**: Synthesizes all results into mechanistic hypotheses and generates scientific-style reports.  

This modular division ensures clarity, maintainability, and extensibility.

### Data Flow & Control Flow  

1. **Input Stage** ‚Äì User inputs herbs/formulas, syndromes, or diseases.  
2. **Agent Collaboration** ‚Äì Each agent works sequentially or concurrently, exchanging intermediate outputs.  
3. **Network & Analysis Stage** ‚Äì Constructs and analyzes networks using graph algorithms and biological data.  
4. **Report Generation** ‚Äì A Report Agent compiles results into readable summaries, explanations, and visualizations.  
5. **Human-in-the-loop** ‚Äì Users can refine or query agents interactively, forming a feedback loop.

### Extensibility  

Each module follows a plug-and-play design, allowing researchers to replace or extend them easily.  
Adapters and hooks can be used to integrate new models, APIs, or visualization components without breaking the existing pipeline.

## 7. Limitations, Challenges & Future Plans

### Current Limitations  

- **Data dependency**: Accuracy relies heavily on public databases.  
- **Prediction noise**: Some targets may be false positives, requiring manual curation.  
- **Scalability**: Large networks may cause high computational costs.  
- **Interpretability**: LLM-generated hypotheses may not always be scientifically rigorous.  
- **Limited feedback loop**: Lack of user‚Äìagent learning or adaptive refinement.  
- **Visualization**: Static reports may not provide deep interactivity.  

### Future Directions  

- Integrate omics and clinical datasets to increase biological relevance.  
- Introduce reinforcement learning for adaptive hypothesis refinement.  
- Support distributed computation for large-scale networks.  
- Add interactive, dynamic web visualization (zoom, highlight, filtering).  
- Extend to Western drugs, microbiome, or host‚Äìpathogen interactions.  
- Provide plugin APIs for external developers to add new agents.  
- Develop evaluation and benchmarking modules using known drug‚Äìtarget‚Äìdisease triplets.
